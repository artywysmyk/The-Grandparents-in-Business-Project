# The-Grandparents-in-Business-Project

## The main goal of this assignment is to learn how to set up and display items dynamically using JavaScript.

This project is inspired by [the Menu Project](https://www.vanillajavascriptprojects.com/) created by John Smilga, as well as the public awareness campaign called [The Grandparents in Business](https://dziadkowiebiznesu.com/) - this wonderful initiative of polish students promotes small shops run by the elderly who find it hard to compete with larger retailers and survive in our digital era.

This is not a finished project. Next, I would like to create a modern looking app where users have other filtering options for their search, could access google maps for easier navigation and directions and share information on local businesses in need of help by submitting a new business for review.
